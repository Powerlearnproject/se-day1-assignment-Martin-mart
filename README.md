#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
-software engeneering is the  art and science of designing, maintaining and developing sftware soutions that solve real-world problems
-the importance of software engeneering is:
    -increased productivity which is achieved by using modern tools and methodologies can streamline the development process, allowing developers to be more productive and 
     complete projects faster.
    -Better Team Collaboration-this is achieved by by using Agile methodologies and continuous integration, software engineering allows for better collaboration among 
     development teams .
    -Better Security: which is achieved by following the Software Development Life Cycle and performing security testing, software engineering can help to prevent 
     security breaches and protect sensitive .
    -Reduced Costs: Early problem identification in software engineering helps minimize expenses by preventing costly bug fixes and feature additions later in development.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
  -mastering complexity
  -Mastering process
  -Mastering machine


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
   -coding - converting software design into tangible code.
   -Design- building the framework
   -Planning- identifying the software purpose and scope.
   -Requirement analysis-Identify the final user specification.
   -Testing- identifying software  for any bugs and glitches

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  -Quality contron in waterfall methodology, detection and fixing is done during regression testing in the last phase of the project while in Agile early detection and 
   fixing is done after every sprint followed by stablization
  -Lessons learnt from previous release in waterfall is implemented in the next release while in agile, the lessons learnt in the previous sprint is implemented in the next 
   sprint
  -In waterfall methodology- there is no risk identification firefighting during testing phase while in Agile early identification and mitigation in every sprint.
  -In waterfall methodology , postmoterm is done after every phase while in agile its done after every sprint in retrospection
  -In waterfall, customer feedback is received at the end of the project while in agile, it's done at the end of every sprint
  -In waterfall, delivery is done at the end of the project while in agile , delivery and demonstration is done at the end of every sprint

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
-the roles of a developer are :
    -maintaining and updating software to keep it functional
    -collaborating with other team members to ensure best practice when developing a software
    -Developing applications, programs and system programming languages and frameworks
    -Reporting to the project manager  about progress of the software.
-Roles of a quality assurance engineer are:
    -Create development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow
    -Analyse the product to identify bugs and suggest changes to make them more efficient.
    -confirms that the software meets the requirement before deployment
    -Develop and execute automation script using open tools
    -Collaborate with stake holders to understand the software requirements
-Roles of a project manager:
    -Create blueprint for the project
    -Deliver the complete software to the client and regulary check its performance
    -Assembles and leads the software development team
    -Discuss the project and it's requirement with the client and software developers

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
   -An IDE enhances readability by automatically formatting text with bold, italics, or colors, providing visual cues and instant feedback on syntax errors.
   -An IDE compiles code into a form the operating system understands, with some languages using just-in-time compiling to convert code into machine code within the 
    application.
   -IDEs boost productivity by automating repetitive development tasks involved in code changes, such as formatting, compiling, and debugging eg Error Detection & Debugging
   -An IDE can make suggestions to complete a code statement when the developer begins typing
   -Programming languages have rules for how statements must be structured. Because an IDE knows these rules, it contains many intelligent features for automatically 
    writing or editing the source code.
  -The IDE allows developers to automate unit tests locally before the software is integrated with other developers' code and more complex integration tests are run
  -Debugging IDE enables a step through the code, line by line, as it runs and inspect code behavior. IDEs also integrate several debugging tools that highlight bugs caused 
   by human error in real time, even as the developer is typing.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
  -Limited Infrastructure - limited high-performance software engineering tools and computing platforms and inefficient data storage architectures.
     - Solution: Software engineers must rely heavily on a robust infrastructure to perform their jobs effectively.
  -Changing Software Requirements - Software requirements are often dynamic and subject to frequent changes, making it challenging for engineers to design and develop solutions that meet users' needs while accounting for future updates and bug fixes.
      -Solution: engineers can adopt approaches like agile development, which emphasizes iterative progress and adaptability, and modular design, which enables flexibility 
       by breaking systems into manageable, independent components.
  -Software Accessibility and Usability - Overly complex software can frustrate or confuse users. 
      -Solution: Use scalable architecture, Emphasize reliability.
  -Software Security - Programming secure software is a complex and challenging task. 
      -Solution: research ways to defend against hacking, malware, phishing, insider and third-party threats
  -Time Constraints - Software engineering is a demanding and time-intensive field, often requiring engineers to work under high pressure to meet tight deadlines.
      - Solution: adopt agile methodologies, such as Scrum, to streamline workflows by dividing large projects into manageable sprints 
  -Rapid technological advancement places considerable pressure on software engineers to stay current
      -Solution: adopting continuous learning practices and using agile methodologies to adapt to emerging trends

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  -Acceptance tests - are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus 
   on 
   replicating user behaviors
  - Integration tests - verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together. It help to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and 
    interfaces work as expected.
  - Unit tests - are close to the source of an application, They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your 
    software. It ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.
  - System testing -Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions.It help to verify that the system meets all functional 
    and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and security


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
-prompt engineering is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.
  -the importance are:
     -Improved user experience - Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt
     -Increased flexibility - A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns
     -developer control - Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
  -Vague Prompt:
"Write about technology."

Improved Prompt:
"Write a 500-word article on how artificial intelligence is transforming the healthcare industry, including examples of AI-driven innovations and their impact on patient care."

Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective:

Clarity: It specifies the topic (AI in healthcare) instead of just "technology."
Specificity: It outlines what aspects to cover (innovations and their impact).
Conciseness: It eliminates ambiguity, ensuring the response is relevant and to the point.
